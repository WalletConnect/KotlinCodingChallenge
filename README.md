# Android Take Home Test

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your technical skills, communication and mindset.

You should exemplify the best work you can do with the provided example and perhaps surprise us with your solution. You have *one* week time to work on the test, but our expectations are that a fraction of the time is needed for the test.

## Submission Procedure
After completing the challenge, push your changes to a remote repo that we can clone from and email the repo to us 

Notes :
   - Meaningful commit history (git) will be a plus.
   - Feel free to add some comments or provide information in `README.md` file about things you would like to improve but didn't have time for this.

## Project - 
* You are expected to add a UI layer to the project using Compose.
* You will display a list that will show all of the `ClothingItems` from the `ClothingRepository` class.
    * Each item in the list needs to show the `title` and the `image` properties of the `ClothingItem` object
* On clicking of an item in the list will open a detail view that will show the selected `ClothingItem`
    * The detail view needs to show the `title`, `price`, `description`, and `image` properties of the `ClothingItem` object

## Notes
There is already `ClothingViewModel` with a `ClothingRepository` setup as a dependency. The `ClothingRepository` has a function to get all `ClothingItem` objects as well as getting a single `ClothingItem` by id. <br>
Feel free to make any changes that will help you build the UI layer in Compose <br>
You are free to suggest and implement any library or code snippet that you think that is going to be useful
for the codebase. But please be sure to add detailed information about your suggestions and why they would be useful.
